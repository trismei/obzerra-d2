# Obzerra User Guide

This guide explains how analysts and partner companies can prepare data for the Obzerra fraud detection platform. Follow the steps below to collect claims, structure CSV uploads, and interpret the results generated by the dashboard.

## Getting Started
1. Gather the latest claims in CSV or spreadsheet form.
2. Review the standard schema below and align your columns before uploading to Obzerra.
3. Sign in to the dashboard and open the **Batch Analysis** tab.
4. Upload your aligned CSV file to generate risk scores and explanations.

## Standard CSV Format
Every organization should adopt the following layout so the platform can analyze files without custom mapping. Columns in **bold** are required for model scoring; optional fields improve accuracy and narrative explanations.

| Column Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **claim_id** | Unique identifier for the claim or case number. | `PH-2024-000123` |
| claimant_name | Full name of the claimant. | `Juan Dela Cruz` |
| **incident_date** | Date of the reported incident (`YYYY-MM-DD`). | `2024-03-18` |
| **incident_hour** | Hour of day the incident occurred (0-23). | `14` |
| **total_amount** | Claimed payout amount in local currency. | `9850.75` |
| claimant_age | Age of the claimant. | `42` |
| claimant_gender | Gender marker if collected for auditing purposes. | `Male` |
| claim_type | Category of claim (auto, property, medical, etc.). | `Auto` |
| incident_city | City or municipality where the incident occurred. | `Quezon City` |
| incident_state | State, province, or region for localization. | `NCR` |
| incident_report_filed | `Yes/No` flag if an official report exists. | `Yes` |
| witnesses | Number of witnesses recorded on the incident report. | `2` |
| police_report_available | `Yes/No` flag indicating police documentation. | `No` |
| claim_description | Short narrative of the incident circumstances. | `Rear-end collision on EDSA during rush hour.` |

### Template Tips
- Save CSV files with UTF-8 encoding and comma separators.
- Remove personally identifiable information that is not required for fraud review.
- If your internal systems use different column names, rename them to match the table above before uploading.
- Optional fields can be left blank; retain the column headers so the platform recognizes the schema.

## Upload Checklist
- [ ] Verify all required columns (`claim_id`, `incident_date`, `incident_hour`, `total_amount`) are populated.
- [ ] Confirm numeric columns only contain numbers (no currency symbols or text).
- [ ] Ensure date columns use ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- [ ] Spot-check a few rows for typos or missing data before uploading.

## Interpreting Results
After processing, Obzerra will show:
- **Risk Score** – Combined rule and ML rating from 0 (low) to 100 (high).
- **Flags Triggered** – Rule-based indicators describing unusual attributes.
- **Model Insights** – Narrative explanation of features that increased or decreased risk.
- **Recommended Action** – Suggested next steps such as routine processing or escalation.

Use these outputs alongside your internal policies to decide on claim approvals or investigations.
